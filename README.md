An attempt to have Whatsapp on old Nokia phones

Self Host this please, for your own safety

Notice: If there is a "SessionNotCreatedException: DevToolsActivePort file doesn't exist" error, or, "selenium.common.exceptions.TimeoutException: Message:" during /login, follow the [Chromedriver Instruction](#chromedriver-instruction)

## Dependencies

- Python

(pip install)
- Flask
- selenium
- undetected-chromedriver

## Usage

```
flask --app waweb run

-- go to /login, scan qr code
-- console should output "hey it works" or check "/logged-in", go to /chats after
-- click on any contact you want
-- now you can read and send message

```

Currently a very early version of the program, lack of features but you can send and read messages

## Chromedriver Instruction
Note: Do this only if you face the errors mentioned in notice. Default ChromeDriver should work just fine.

[Chromedriver Linux,Win,Mac](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable)

replace the stable version in the download links with "131.0.6778.264", download both "chrome" and "chromedriver" for your platform

unzip both zip files, for ease of access, move the chromedriver executable to the chrome folder

set the variable chrome_path (in waweb.py) to the full path of your chrome executable

and set the variable chromedriver_path on line (in waweb.py) to the full path of your chromedriver executable

[Chromedriver Termux Android](https://github.com/termux-user-repository/chromium-builder/releases/)

Download release 131.0.6778.264 for your architecture, unzip ,set above mentioned variables to the full path of chrome and chromedriver executables.
